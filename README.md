# Project-1-College-Recruitment-Improvement-Study
In this project, we were given the task to 'improve CCM's recruitment process and increase the number of individuals in its computing classes and majors' through studying the reviewing the data provided by a survey sent out by the school. 
The questions that I set out to answer from this survey data was:

-How many people have already participated in CCM tech events in the past?
-Which programs had the highest impact on peoples decision to enroll in a CCM computing course?
-What is the main goal of people seeking a computing goal/certificate at CCM?
-Is a computing major a typical first choice for students or do many people switch into it?
-Look at the records of just the Non-Computing Majors taking Computing Major classes. This group includes: Challenger, ShareTime, Non-Degree Seeking, Undecided and all those who selected Other. What is the interest level for taking another computing class? Show a bar chart with the count for each interest level.
